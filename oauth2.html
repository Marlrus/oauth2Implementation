                <p class="paragraph">
                    O Auth stands for Open Authorization and allows to login into an app with 3rd party accounts. This is great for us as developers, and great for users as it centralizes logins. Users will press the button to login, they will be redirected to a consent screen and then they will login to our website. We can store a version of their profile in our app using the data from google. We will do this through <em>passport.js</em>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    When the user clocks on the button for OAuth, we will redirect them to a route in our webApp <em>/auth/provider</em> where provider is whichever provider they choose to do a 3rd party login with. We handle these routes within our application in our Server Express App (Node). This then redirects to the OAuth provider consent screen that grants permission. We then redirect to a custom route <em>/auth/provider/cb</em> where <u>cb</u> stands for <em>callback</em>. In this route we have access to the user information. Here we handle whether the user has been here before or not and do something depending on the status. For either of these we will have a version of our user in our on db. After that we create a unique cookie which gets sent to the browser. The browser stores that cookie which allows us to navigate pages with your auth through the decoding of the cookie and retrieval of user information. <strong>Note:</strong> There are a few other things that need to be done in between, but this is the main gist of it.

                    <strong>Passport</strong>
                    <br>
                    We will use passport when: We handle the "auth/provider" route in our app. When we recieve user details from the provider. When we create a unique cookie. And when we decode the cookie and retrieve user information (serializing and deserializing).

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Just basic setup for an express App using EJS. Copied from other apps of mine. Then we create the basic routes and templates. A few auth routes and we set the navs. I used the partials for navs instead of having them in each template with the style tag. This finishes the setup before installing Passport.

                <h2 class="subtitle">Basic Passport Setup</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    We need to install a few packages. One being strategies, which are the ways to login using 3rd party auth. We install two packages <em>passport and passport-google-oauth20</em>. We then create a directory for passport configuration called config. Inside we create a file <em>passport-setup.js</em>. Inside this file we require both packages under the const passport and GoogleStrategy. We then set up the start for the strategy with <code>passport.use(new GoogleStrategy({optionsForStrategy})</code>
                </p>

            <li class="list-group-item">
                <h2 class="subtitle">Google Strategy Setup</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    We need to use the GoogleAPI to use OAuth. We are going to need a few things, for auth we need a <em>client ID</em> and a <em>client secret</em> from <em>google developer console</em>. We need a user there to set this up. We need to create a new project here. We then have to Enable APIs and Services, we do this by clicking on the button. For OAuth2.0 we need to use the Google+ API. <strong>Note:</strong> The Google+ API is not the solution, now we must use another API <em>Google People</em>.
                </p>

            <li class="list-group-item">
                <h2 class="subtitle">Google API and Credentials</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    We need to go to <a href="console.cloud.google.com" target="_blank">The google Cloud Platform</a> to get the API and credentials we need. First we create a project to manage API Keys and Credentials. Once that is done, we go the API & Services tab and click on Credentials and then create credentials. We add the URL <em>http://localhost:3000</em> and then on the other field add <em>http://localhost:3000/whatever</em> which we will change. Once that is done we get a <em><u>client Id: and client secret</u></em> which we need for the passport-setup. We save these in our .env using the dotenv package which we require with <code>require('dotenv').config()</code> in our <em>.env</em> file we use the following format <code>VARIABLE_NAME=value</code>, we call it in our app using <code>process.env.VARIABLE_NAME</code> <strong>Note:</strong> The Net Ninja uses another way to hide the info through a js file <em>keys.js</em> he uses <code>module.exports = {google: {clientID:'value',clientSecret:'value'}}</code> and adds the file to our .gitignore file so it doesn't get uploaded. He gets them to the template through require <code>const keys = require(./keys)</code> and uses it through <code>keys.google.clientID</code> and the same for clientSecret.
                </p>

            <li class="list-group-item">
                <h2 class="subtitle">The Redirect URI</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    We change the Authorized Redirect URIs from our credentials to <em>http://localhost:3000/auth/google/redirect</em> which will be our callback route. We must also add this URI in our GoogleStrategy through <code>callbackURL:'/auth/google/redirect'</code> Now we have to focus on our route that takes the user to our consent screen <code>/auth/google</code>. We require passport in our auth-routes. We change our route to <code>router.get('/google',passport.authenticate('google', scope:['profile']))</code> it uses the passport object, the autheticate method, and it knows through 'google' that it has to redirect to the google consent screen (Something to do with us having a GoogleStrategy). The second parameter is the <em>scope</em> which tells Google what information you want to retireve from the user. Other options can be sought in the Google API, but we just have 'profile' at the moment. We have the set up but we are not using the code anywhere, we need to require it first! To fix this we require it in our app.js through <code>passportSetup   = require('./config/passport-setup')</code> This associates the GoogleStrategy to the passport object. Now we get sent to the google consent screen, however, when we click we get redirected to <em>/auth/google/redirect</em> a route which we haven't handled. This is the route we sepcified in our passport-setup for the GoogleStrategy in the <em>callbackURL</em> property. We create a rote handler with a simple res.send and we see that we have a query string in our URL now <code>redirect?code=4%2FvwGSztOVJw41xi6pOL4-7Mla4DsTzBaY-CFzo1YHUPrZLlB-V1lMcDL9PTMgJP78VDKyJJqajGWn62BlM60qg7k&scope=profile+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fuserinfo.profile#</code> This is what Passport can use to retrieve information from Google.

                <h2 class="subtitle">The Passport Callback</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    We just have the query string in the URL. The flow until now user goes through our app to auth/google/ which redirects to the consent screen. This then gives us a code (in the query string) from google in the redirect URI. The next step is to exchange code for information using passport. After this is done, it launchs the passport callback function. We first add <code>passport.authenticate('google')</code> to the <em>/google/redirect</em> route (Reason unclear/something to do with passport getting the info back from google. I removed the code and got sent to the route res.send but got no information). Then we use the callback function. The passport callback function has 4 parameters <code>(accessToken,refreshToken,profile,done)=>{}</code> accessToken gives us access to whatever information the client consented to, refreshToken refreshes the duration of the accessToken (it expires), profile is the information for the profile (defined in scope), and done is what lets us leave the function. Insde the function we use <code>console.log(profile)</code> which returns the information JSON object.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    What we want to do with the callback is lookup/create user on our db (mongo in this case). mLab is like mongoDB Atlas. I will use mongoDB Atlas instead. I do the standard process I often do now and set up the DB_URI in the .env file to be called using process.env.DB_URI.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    We create a model directory where we create our user schema. This guy goes about it a bit different, saving Schema as a const and saving the Model as a const as well. <code>const Schema = mongoose.Schema</code> this means we do <code>const userSchema = new Schema{}</code> instead of the code we usually use. <code>const User = mongoose.model('User',userSchema)</code> this means we do <code>module.exports = User</code> instead of our usual code. This ends this episode, we must require it to work though.

                <h2 class="subtitle">Saving Users to MongoDB</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    To save the data to our DB we do it in the passport-setup.js file inside the callback function. We have to require our new User model to use it. Inside the callback function we do the same code we usually do. In the video, The Net Ninja uses promises and doesn't use the create() method, instead he does <code>new User({dataObject}).save(callbackFunction)</code> I refactored to async and used <code>const newUser = await User.create({dataObject})</code> which is much cleaner and allows a console.log outside of using a callback function.

                <h2 class="subtitle">Retrieving records, not duplicating Users</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    When someone logs in, we want to check whether the user exists already in our database so we don't create duplicates and we can ID the user. This is done in the callback before we create the user. We use the mongoose method findOne() and use google_id as our search parameter. I refactored everything to async <code>const existingUser = await User.findOne({google_id: profile.id})</code> we then use an if statement <code>if(existingUser){}else{}</code>. If the query returns a value, we can handle the data differently, if there is no existingUser then we can create one with the code we had before.

                <h2 class="subtitle">Serializing & Desirializing Users</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    We take and id property from their record and stuff that into a cookie that gets sent to the browser. Then when the browser communicates with the page, it will know that the user was authenticated through the cookie and who the user is. We will use <em>_id</em> from our DB. Serializing is stuffing this into into a cookie, deserializing is getting the info from that user and decoding what user it is from that cookie. This is done through two functions. We create declare functions for getting the cookie into the browser, and the function for getting a user from that cookie. Serialize is <code>passport.serializeUser((user,done)=>{done(null,user._id)})</code> this one takes the user we have and serializes the user using our _id value. The desirialize function is <code>passport.deserializeUser((_id,done)=>{User.findById(_id).then((user)=>{done(null,user)})</code> which finds a user using _id and then returns a user to be used. We call done in our google strategy for when the user exists, or when there is no user!

                <h2 class="subtitle">Setting up the session</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Up until now, this is an act of fate, for we have not set up a way to handle the cookies through a session. We will use the package <em>cookie-session</em>, we require it in our app.js and then use it with <code>app.use(cookieSession({maxAge:timeInMs,keys:[process.env.COOKIE_KEY]}))</code> the COOKIE_KEY is something we create that is used to encript and decript the cookie. Then we need to require passport in app.js and initialize it. We use <code>app.use(passport.initialize())</code> and <code>app.use(passport.session())</code>. <strong>Note:</strong> I would have, without a shadow of a doubt, done this step before the last step in order to be able to troubleshoot the code. If we made a mistake we wouldn't know until now and it would be a disaster.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    We test our setup by clicking the button we had and realizing that it doesn't hang anymore. This means we are now logged in to the session. Our passport package does something else pretty cool, that is attach our user to the <em><u>req</u></em> object, that allows us to access user parameters directly. This allows us to use that data iniside a view if we want to.

                <h2 class="subtitle">Redirecting Users</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Redirect based on auth status. We want to redirect the user to a profile page once they are logged in. We don't have routes for profile so we create a file <em>profile-routes.js</em> where we will handle those routes. There we will require router and do module.exports. The route is <code>router.get('/', authCheck, (req,res)=>{res.send('PROFILE ' + req.user.first_name)})</code> where we are running a middleware function authCheck to handle users. We declare a function <code>const authCheck</code> that will check whether a user is logged in or not through <code>if(req.user){}else{}</code>. Passport will store the user in <em>req.user</em> therefore if it exists the user is logged in and it will trigger <code>next()</code> which will make the route continue to execute and send us to the profile page. If not, we use <code>res.redirect('/auth/login')</code> which redirects the user to the login page.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    We do our standard process, we <code>req.render('profile')</code> on our redirect route. We create that template inside our views folder and then we copy the home.ejs template. We want to use the information in our template, so we send the req.user object through to the template using <code>res.render('profile', {user: req.user})</code>. We call it in our profile.ejs using the stadard ejs format.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Too see our header cookies we head into the dev tools f12, network, and then refresh the page. then we can go into the requests and click on profile/ then we can see headers which will show us header info and our cookie. This is what we want to remove when we logout so there is no cookie to check for. We do this with the passport method <em>logout()</em> inside our /auth/logout route. <code>req.logout()</code> and then we redirect to home with <code>res.redirect('/')</code> which will redirect them to the '/' route which is the homepage. When we check the header again, we can see a cookie, however this cookie does not hold the id information required for authentication. We try to go to /profile and get redirected to the login page. Now we want to do conditional displaying in the header for the login and logout button. In this tutorial, The Net Ninja has a header on each template so he has to copy and paste the whole code on every single template, fortunately we created a header partial so we only have to change that one. The other thing that he does differently is that he sends the user object to every route independently, I use locals instead <code>app.use((req,res,next)={ res.locals.user = req.user next()})</code>. This line sends a user object to every template that takes the value from req.user. <strong>Note:</strong> The placement of this code in the app.js file is very improtant, do it before the route set up or it will not work.

                    To apply everything we just did using other 3rd party services like Facebook or Github, we do the same thing except we use a facebookStrategy, or a gitHubStrategy for each case. We just have to handle the data differently, as the format that each page has for the data is different. This last video is about storing the google image URL and then using that on our profile template to display. I had already saved that data beforehand so I just had to use EJS to call it in the profile.
